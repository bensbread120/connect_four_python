# connect_four_python
The aim of this program is to make an effective command line connect four game using object oriented python.
This game will have two players versing each other both using command line inputs to win or lose.
At the beginning of the first game and end of each game the players will be asked if they would like to play again, at which point the program will loop the game code again.
My aim is to make this game both fun and user friendly as well as hopefully having a nice layout on the command line screen.
